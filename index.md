      <ul>
        <li>Suggested a monotonic approximate attribute reduction model named
            parameterized maximum distribution entropy (PMDE), which assigns
            different significance scores to various decisions</li>
        <li>Propositioned a heuristic attribute selection algorithm by
            introducing the idea of three-way decision, leading to a robust
            reduction of attributes</li>
        <li>Conducted numerous experiments on UCI's datasets, which demonstrated
            the effectiveness of the planned method with much fewer attributes
            over baseline methods</li>
