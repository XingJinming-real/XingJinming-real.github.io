       <a href="/PDME.pdf">Parameterized-Maximum-Distribution-Entropy based Three-Way Approximate Attribute Reduction</a>
        
* Suggested a monotonic approximate attribute reduction model named
    parameterized maximum distribution entropy (PMDE), which assigns
    different significance scores to various decisions
* Propositioned a heuristic attribute selection algorithm by
    introducing the idea of three-way decision, leading to a robust
    reduction of attributes
* Conducted numerous experiments on UCI's datasets, which demonstrated
    the effectiveness of the planned method with much fewer attributes
    over baseline methods

* Proposed bad-points technique for dataset denoising and high-order
    strategy is used to extract further comprehensive spatial
    information
* Initiated three modal data ORI (original data), PCA (data after
    PCA), and DIS (data after discretization) to prime the tri-training
    base classifiers, augmenting their representation abilities
* Designed a robust weighted fuzzy lower approximation classifier to
    solve the supervised and semi-supervised problems
